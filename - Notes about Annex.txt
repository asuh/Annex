Annex starts with the Twenty Eleven theme...
  mixes in HTML5 Boilerplate (http://html5boilerplate.com/)...

	The only extraneous items left in the mark-up are the two favicon references in header.php; read about it there.

* The directory "- MOVE TO ROOT" is filled with HTML5 Boilerplate goodness that 
  should be copied FROM that directory and pasted TO your blog's root directory.
* The .htaccess in that directory is filled with things which I honestly do not understand...
  I had to comment-out several items in order to get my WP installation to work, so, play if you like.

Be sure to read these "read me" type files as well:
	- _READ_ME.txt and _LICENSE.txt are from Starkers Theme
	- README.markdown is from HTML5 Boilerplate

Thanks,
